- Phosphate rock reserves = 2x10e9 tonnes that is "Economically, energetically, legally and geopolitically feasible" (see `docs/sustainability-03-02027f1-1024.png`)
- From `docs/HCSS_17_12_12_Phosphate.pdf`:
    - ~90% of global phosphate rock demand is used for food production
    - Phosphate rock is non-renewable
    - UN estimates global pop over 9bil by 2050
        - world food production needs to increase by 70% to support this pop
    - Morocco, China, US, Russia most important producers of phosphate
    - Majority of rock reserves are in Morocco and Western Sahara
    - Iraq, China, Algeria, Syria, Jordan, South Africa, US, Russia have major phosphate rock reserves
    - Phosphate rock mining
        - requires water, energy
        - contributes to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions
    - Phosphate fertilizer flow causes algae bloom (eutrophication)
    - USGS estimated reserves at 60,000mmt
        - Peak based on this estimated to occur b/w 2051 and 2092, mean of 2070
    - USGS estimated global phosphate rock production at 181mmt in 2010 and 191 mmt in 2011
